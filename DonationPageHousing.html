    <h1>The Connecting between Homelessness and housing</h1>
    <p>In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This prompts the question Why does is seem like some US cities struggle more with homelessness?</p>

    <p>This page examines the trends and the many causes that have been ascribed to homelessness.
         A common storyline to blamed homelessness on actually lies in the varying housing markets and their locations.
         housing market conditions explain the most variation in rates of homelessness observed around the country.
          Cities with higher rents and lower rental-vacancy rates (i.e., tighter housing markets) see higher per capita rates of homelessness.
           This is where a fuller picture comes into view. 
           Individual risk factors help account for who in a given city might lose their housing at any given point in time, 
           but housing markets—rents and vacancy rates—set the context in which those risk factors are expressed. </p>

    <p class="img-background">In December 2022, there were 68,884 homeless people, including 21,805 homeless children, sleeping each night in New York City’s main municipal shelter system. A near-record 22,720 single adults slept in shelters each night in December 2022.

    <h2> Here's a list of reasons as to why you should help those less fortunate than you:</h2>
    <ui>

        <li class="tribute-info">The living condtions are harsh and brutal. Its not a suprise that living on the streets 
            can hard, help out where you can.  <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/14mc1VoAfM153q/giphy.gif"> </li>
        <li class="tribute-info">Families entering shelters predominantly come from a few clustered zip codes in the poorest neighborhoods in New York City. However, homeless families and single adults come from every community district in NYC prior to entering shelters. <img src="https://www.nydailynews.com/resizer/uRVz6_YkE7bg0ZDSGlJFdYRSArU=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I54KH4ZPA2BPCLUMWNTOIK5CX4.jpg">   </li>

    
        <li class="tribute-info">  The chart below shows that according to the 2019 point-in-time (PIT) count (the annual census of homelessness around the country), in King County, about 5 in every 1,000 people experience homelessness on a given night. In sunny Miami-Dade County in Florida, that number is closer to 1 per 1,000.

        </li>
        <li class="tribute-info">For many observers, homelessness is a function of mental illness, 
            drug use, and overly generous social policies. These explanations are often supported by anecdotes,
             and certainly academic research confirms that a range of individual vulnerabilities,
             including poverty, substance abuse, and mental illness, increase one’s risk of homelessness.

        <li class="tribute-info"> There is a shortage of nearly 7 million affordable and available homes for the 10.8 million extremely low-income renter households across the country. 
            As a result, 70% of these households are severely housing cost-burdened, spending more than half of their incomes on rent and utilities. 
            This shortage is a long-term problem that requires significant government action. 
            The market on its own will never produce an adequate supply of affordable, accessible homes for all renters.

        </li>
        <li class="tribute-info">
            The shortage of affordable and available homes for the lowest-income renters is also a shortage of accessible homes.
             Renters with disabilities and older renters with impairments are likely to struggle to find adequate homes that meet their needs. 
             Thirty percent of extremely low-income renter households are seniors, with a head of household 62 years or older. 
             In another 18% of extremely low-income renter households, one adult member of the household has a disability. 
             Together they account for over 5 million households.

        </li>

        <li class="tribute-info">Estimates of what taxpayers spend on an individual experiencing chronic homelessness vary widely.
             One study, conducted in Philadelphia, estimated a yearly cost of $22,372 per person. 
            The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness cites studies estimating costs between $30,000 and $50,000 a year.
            Rankin points to studies that put individual costs much higher, between $50,000 and $80,000. The chronically homeless, she explains, are more likely to use emergency services such as ambulances. Dispatching law enforcement to move them or ticket them for loitering often adds to these costs. <img src="https://auma.ca/sites/default/files/housing_cost_of_housing_homeless.jpg"> </li>

        <li class="tribute-info">When individuals and families are housing cost-burdened, they often have to cut back on basic necessities like food, transportation,
             and healthcare, and they often have no ability to save for emergencies. COVID-19 was just such an emergency.
             The vast majority of jobs lost in 2020 were held by the lowest-wage workers, who were less likely to be able to perform their jobs remotely.</li>

    <p class="adjustment3"> Over 30% of the lowest-income renters said they had fallen behind on rent,
         and half of them anticipated an eviction if they did not receive help. Renters with mobility issues, 
        difficulty seeing or hearing, or cognitive limitations were all more likely than renters in general to have fallen behind.</p>
